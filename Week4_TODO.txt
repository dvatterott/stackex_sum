TODO:
- 1. Use lime to look at what my model likes...AND ADD SLIDE ABOUT THIS
x 2. add slides to website
/ 2. Try to combine the good answer finding system and the highlighting systems
/ 3. Maybe look into training my own method for finding sentence breaks...
x 4. Make sure the linear plots are actually from my linear regression and not from random forest
x 5. combine roc plots in inkscape (if using the plots from the linear model)
x 6. Make neural network graph slide
x 7. make technical error backup slides
x 8. edit axes on slides (answer histograms and viewcount x answerscore)
x 9. change slide link to the most recent version of slides
x 10. make the app say something if nothing to highlight
x 11. look into how much I can shrink the size of my aws instance.
x 12. add icon to tabs!
x 13. make new classification vs regression slide (show what percent of answers are above a ratings of 2...)
x 14. remake all plots with seaborn style... (just turn off the center part for confusion matrices. there's an easy style command for this)
- 15. get 2016 data and look at how often my model likes the first answer vs the second ect.
x 16. put stackoverflow password on my t2 aws instance (bash_profile or bashrc)
- 17. build model with residuals after removing variance explained by view count.

Presentation notes:
 * make the summary more summarary
 * Lots of questions about how decided to label answers with a score of 2 as "helpful." basically, how much can we trust this. how could i improve groundtruth? regressing out number of views...
 * unclear why bad recall is ok
 * what answers tend to be highlighted? how often not the first answer? (how often not first and why does this happen)
 * description of RNN
x* would the model improve with more data?
x* what could be a business application

FOR LIME PLOT - MAYBE THIS SHOULD BE NUMBER OF TIMES A WORD APPEARED IN THIS TOP LIST... weighted by the frequency of the word??

  XX. update blog post and images to match presentation!
  XX. work on linkedin
  XX. clean github
  XX. reread bengio chapter on recurrent neural nets

TAGLINES:
  Highlight helpful parts of Stack Overflow answers

x = done
/ = on ice
- = in progress

Threshold. And color items according to how helpful (shades of yellow)
Maybe look at only the code and learn good code vs bad code

Functional links: 5/5.
Text Quality: 4/5 Improve structure, headings, readability.
Intended User: 3/5 Make this super clear with a goal statement that is highlighted.
Context: 5/5 Great graphs giving context to results. Easy to read and well explained.
Features: 4/5 Having to read through the page to find highlights can be time consuming. Top summary could be useful but might be hard to implement in time.
Intuitive: 4/5 Improve link titles.
Understand how to use: 4/5 Link titles would improve this.
About Me: 5/5 Great content.
Well designed: 3/5. Lacks some visual appeal. Block elements, better text formatting, better fonts, more chunking of details could improve it substantially.
