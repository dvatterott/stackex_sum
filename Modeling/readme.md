### Models

Classifying_Answers.ipynb is the code used to create a bow representation and train a logistic regression on this representation.
  I tried some more complex models using this bow representation, but the models did not perform much better than the logistic regression.

Classifying_Answers_RNN_aws.ipynb is the code used to train my recurrent neural net. This model was trained on an aws instance with a gpu.
