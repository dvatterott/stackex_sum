### Explaining Text Cleaning

This folder contains the code used for hitting the stackoverflow and cleaning the text that I get back from stackoverflow.
There are different files for the embedding and the bow representations because I used more aggressive cleaning with the bow representation.

* Download_StackOverflow_RNN was used to collect data for my rnn
* Download_StackOverflow_RNN was used to collect data for the bow model

This files rely on StackExchange_Query.py which is a file that appears multiple times in this repository...very sloppy. Just make super to copy it around if edited.
