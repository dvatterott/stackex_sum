TODO:
- 1. Use lime to look at what my model likes...AND ADD SLIDE ABOUT THIS
x 2. add slides to website
/ 2. Try to combine the good answer finding system and the highlighting systems
/ 3. Maybe look into training my own method for finding sentence breaks...
x 4. Make sure the linear plots are actually from my linear regression and not from random forest
x 5. combine roc plots in inkscape (if using the plots from the linear model)
x 6. Make neural network graph slide
x 7. make technical error backup slides
x 8. edit axes on slides (answer histograms and viewcount x answerscore)
x 9. change slide link to the most recent version of slides
x 10. make the app say something if nothing to highlight
x 11. look into how much I can shrink the size of my aws instance.
x 12. add icon to tabs!
x 13. make new classification vs regression slide (show what percent of answers are above a ratings of 2...)
x 14. remake all plots with seaborn style... (just turn off the center part for confusion matrices. there's an easy style command for this)
x 15. get 2016 data and look at how often my model likes the first answer vs the second ect.
x 16. put stackoverflow password on my t2 aws instance (bash_profile or bashrc)
x 17. build model with residuals after removing variance explained by view count.
  18. replace rnn ipynb notebook...

Presentation notes:
 * make the summary more summarary
x* Lots of questions about how decided to label answers with a score of 2 as "helpful." basically, how much can we trust this. how could i improve groundtruth? regressing out number of views...
 * unclear why bad recall is ok
x* what answers tend to be highlighted? how often not the first answer? (how often not first and why does this happen)
 * description of RNN
x* would the model improve with more data?
x* what could be a business application

FOR LIME PLOT - MAYBE THIS SHOULD BE NUMBER OF TIMES A WORD APPEARED IN THIS TOP LIST... weighted by the frequency of the word??

x XX. update blog post and images to match presentation!
  XX. work on linkedin
x XX. clean github
  XX. reread bengio chapter on recurrent neural nets

TAGLINES:
  Highlight helpful parts of Stack Overflow answers

x = done
/ = on ice
- = in progress

Threshold. And color items according to how helpful (shades of yellow)
Maybe look at only the code and learn good code vs bad code

Presentation:
be quicker in the demo. take more time on the model validation slide (make sure to explain). put the results up one at time - roc curve then confusion matrix.
don't say that I would like to talk about this more later so often.
