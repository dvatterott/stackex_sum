In particular, the stemming/lemmatization step reduces the number of unique versions of a word that appear in the corpus.

If the documents are all related to the same political initiative, then very likely there will be words related to the intitiative that appear in both documents and thus have high frequency counts. If we cap the number of features by frequency, these words would likely be included, but will they be the most informative when trying to differentiate documents?\n",

    "\n",
    "When we decided to tokenize our corpus above, we decided to treat each word as a token.  A collection of text represented by single words only is a **unigram model of the data**.  This representation can often be surprisingly powerful, because the presence of single words can be hugely informative. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when dealing with natural language we often want to incorporate structure that is present - grammer, syntactic meaning, and tone.  The **downside of unigrams is that it ignores the ordering of words**, as the order of the token counts is not captured.  The simplest model that captures ordering and structure is one that treats neighboring word pairs as tokens, this is called a **bigram** model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example consider a document that has the words \"good\", \"bad\", and \"project\" in its corpus (with relatively similar count frequencies).  From unigrams alone, its not possible to tell whether the project is good or bad, because those adjectives could appear next to the subject \"project\" or in completely unrelated sentences.  With bigrams, we might then see the token \"good project\" appearing frequently and we would now know significantly more what the document is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing pairs of words (bigrams) is just the simplest choice we can make. We can generalize this allow tokens of N numbers of words, these are called **Ngrams**.  When N=3 we refer to tokens as trigrams, but for higher values of N we do not typically assign a unique name. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Best practices:*** Generally speaking most NLP models want to have unigrams present.  Very commonly bigrams are important and are also used to build high quality models.  Typically higher order Ngrams are less common, as the number of features (and computational requirements) increase rapidly and yield diminishing returns."

    "### Word Embeddings\n",
    "Another vectorization option is to use a word embedding model to generate vector representations of words. Word embedding models create non-linear representations of words, which account for the context and neighboring language surround a word.  A common model(which has many pretrained libraries) is [Word2Vec](http://p.migdal.pl/2017/01/06/king-man-woman-queen-why.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embedding models have gained lots of popularity, as they are able to capture syntactic meaning quite well.  However, good vector representations are only appropriate for the corpus they are trained on and often they will not generate good models for corpuses which are significantly different.  For instance, a Word2Vec model trained on literature may not be appropriate for Twitter or StackOverflow text data.  The alternative in these cases is to retrain the model on the correct data, but this is hard - it requires lots of data, choices, and computation to generate good representations.  As a first approach, it's probably best to start with Ngrams using counts or tf-idf weightings."
