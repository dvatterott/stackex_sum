# Sifting the Overflow

[Sifting the Overflow](http://siftingtheoverflow.com/) is a chrome extension I built while a Data Science Fellow at Insight.
The link above directs users to a landing page where users can test Sifting the Overflow and the model underlying Sifting the Overflow
is explained.

Sifting the Overflow can be installed from the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sifting-the-overflow/japbeffaagcpbjilckaoigpocdgncind?hl=en-US&gl=US).

This folder contains code used for all aspects of the project.
The folder Cleaning_text contains the code used to gather data from the Stackoverflow API using [Py-StackExchange](https://github.com/lucjon/Py-StackExchange).
