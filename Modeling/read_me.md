### models

In this folder I have the code used for training the different models that Sifting the Overflow has used.
Classifying_Answers.ipynb is the code used for developing a logistic regression model with a bow representation.
  I tried some more complex models using this bow representation, but these models were not much better than the logistic regression.
Classifying_Answers_RNN_aws.ipynb is the code used by the current model underlying Sifting the Overflow. It's a RNN that was trained on an aws instance with a GPU.
